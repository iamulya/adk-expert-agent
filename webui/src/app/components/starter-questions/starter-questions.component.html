      Hello! I'm here to help you with your queries about Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK).
      I can answer any ADK related question, even provide you guidance about any of ADK's GitHub issues. 
      Furthermore, I can output the information you request in pdf, slides and can also generate architecture diagrams.
