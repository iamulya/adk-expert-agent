      <br />
      Hello! I am an <b>expert</b> in Google's <b>Agent Development Kit (ADK)</b>.
      <br />
      <br />
      I can answer <b>any ADK related question</b>, help you <b>debug and fix errors</b> in your ADK code, even provide you guidance about any of <b>ADK's GitHub issues</b> and <b>generate unit tests</b> for ADK components. 
      <br />
      <br />
      Furthermore, I can output the information you request in <b>pdf, slides</b> and can also <b>generate architecture diagrams</b>.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>Important: </b>Since the best model is being used to give you the most accurate and detailed answers, it can take some time to respond to certain queries where deeper analysis is required.
